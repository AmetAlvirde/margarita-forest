# Margarita Forest

When I was younger, an old friend who was my boss, introduced me to the
"Margarita" concept. He was the leader of our team and we wanted to create apps
that could eventually evolve into a startup, so we tried to be as fast paced as
possible

So one the, while brainstorming about a new idea, we got to the most feared
stage of the process, the vast majority of ideas cannot withstand the
ruthlessness of the following questions:

"So... What do we name it? is it registered? are its social network
handles free?"

We were diving into a freezing spiral when he said:

Margarita.

Let's say we name it "Margarita" and we have all the domains and handles. This
is a good idea, we need to keep moving

And Margarita it was. We corrected course and started discussing about features
and bussines models. I don't remember if we ended up building that specific
idea, but the important idea of that experience, was the so called: "Project
Margarita"

This is the Margarita Forest

A forest of ideas for components, apps and products that live without the
burden of knowledge. Free of constant freezing decisions on infrastructure,
architecture or tooling, free to have known bugs and quirks, because that is
not important

The most important goal of this forest, is to be creative and free of judgement.
To write code frequently, so experiments can be published as soon as possible
and get immediate feedback

To give ideas a high level of importance, because not all ideas will evolve
into a product, but every idea that gets to reality, got there because it
was treated with a high level of importance.
